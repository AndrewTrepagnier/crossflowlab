# crossflowlab
The purpose of this project is to simulate heat transfer performances of a rectangluar-fin crossflow heat exhcanger. Crossflow heatexchangers can be designed with a wide variety of shapes and orientations, from fin geometry to fluid flow regime. This package is desinged for rechangular fin geometries, such as the visualization below.
